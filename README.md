I have developed this Application in Java, Springboot, Hibernate, and  MySQL. Itâ€™s a web-based project so I have used HTML, CSS,  JavaScript and Bootstrap also.  
The main feature of the project is to make hotel booking easier. You can  access this website from anywhere and everywhere.  
   
   Admin :
Here,Admin can login and access booking detail and employee related information after that Admin will redirect to Admin dashboard here Admin have two modules :
Booking List
Employee List
In the booking list, admin can see different users booking the rooms and can perform CRUD operations like edit ,delete and update the list.
In the employee list admin can see all details of employees who are working in HBHR'S hotel and perform CRUD operations like edit, delete and update the list.
Booking Form:
The guests after signing up giving their details they are redirected to the booking form page where the guests can book the type of hotel rooms they need.
Guest :
The guests can open the hotel website and view the different pages of the hotel. The guests can see about the hotel by clicking the about us option and the guests can also view the attractions page and find different images of the hotel to get better idea of the hotel rooms and halls. The guests can sign up by clicking the sign up option from the home page or from the about us page. In sign up page the guests should give their details and then the booking page will open. The guests can select the type of rooms and book the hotel room. After that the payment page will be redirected to the guest with different payment options where the guests can do the payment by which the hotel gets booked. Also the guests can go to the feedback page in home and give their feedback so the hotel facilities can be updated.

Aboutus :
In about us page the users can read about the hotel details, services provided and the view of the hotel. It also redirects the user to the hotel booking page to sign up.
Payment :
To get the guest to book the hotel we use the payment option where the guest can use different payment methods like using cash to pay or cards by giving the  costumer card details. After choosing the cash method or by doing using the card payment method the hotel gets booked for the guest and then he gets a pop up message that the hotel room is booked.
